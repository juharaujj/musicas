Tank God
Ayy (ayy)
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (mm)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grah-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow), ayy, ayy
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott, " ayy
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison, ayy
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car, ayy
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin'
Don't give a damn, dude, your girlfriend is a groupie
She just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band"
Ayy, ayy
Now she actin' outta pocket
Tryna grab up on my pants, hundred bitches in my trailer
Say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend
Yeah, ayy (ayy, ayy)
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (mm)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grah-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow)
I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "No m√°s!" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (Kiss that)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (bitch)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the Coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard?
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar (ayy)
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas (uh)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grah-ta-ta-ta (ta, grah-ta-ta-ta-ta)
'Star, 'star
Rockstar
Rockstar (rockstar)
Rockstar, feel just like a-
Rockstar (rockstar)
Rockstar, yeah (feel just like a-)
